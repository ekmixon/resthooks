REST Hooks are a lightweight subscription layer on top of your existing REST API.

The real-time web is already here, but REST APIs haven't kept up. Many major players have already standardized upon subscription webhooks. REST Hooks are a way to consolidate that momentum and push it to a broarder audience.

For more information, code examples, libraries, and company profiles check out [http://resthooks.org](http://resthooks.org).

## How to run locally.

Clone the repo and hop into the correct directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:zapier/resthooks.git && cd resthooks
```

Next, you'll want to make a virtual environment (we recommend using
virtualenvwrapper but you could skip this) and then install dependencies:

```
mkvirtualenv resthooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the server!

```
foreman run web
# or
python resthooks.py
```
